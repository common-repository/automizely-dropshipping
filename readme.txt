###3-10 Days Shipping to the US

Customers are more likely to buy again and again from you if you are providing fast shipping across marketplaces. 38% of the customers never buy again from an online seller following a negative delivery experience. Hence it is evident that you need to keep up with the fast-evolving customer expectations by offering fast and reliable shipping to avoid losing business. AliExpress Dropshipping ensures a speedy delivery within 3-10 days to the US to help you exceed your customer’s delivery expectations and build customer retention & brand loyalty.

###Instant Product Search

Many dropshippers are generally overwhelmed by the task of choosing the hot-selling products, especially when they are just starting with their dropshipping business, as they want to ensure that they are selling the right products that are in demand and people will actually buy them. This is where a robust product research tool comes in handy.
You can save time and effort by leveraging AliExpress Dropshipping’s ‘Instant Product Search’ feature that helps you automatically hunt down winning products for you, and you can instantly find the products you are looking for.

You can easily import products from a wide range of available categories such as electronics, fashion, health & fitness, furniture, home & pets, home improvement, shoes & bags, beauty, phones, accessories, and a lot more. You name the category, it's there. In case you don’t want to stick to a particular category, just pick the best-selling products from the ‘Best Sellers’ category and start selling the hot products in just a few clicks.

###3-10 Days Trackable Delivery to the US

For dropshipping businesses, it is crucial to not just deliver the products quickly but also to let their buyers know the current running position of their package and exactly when it would get delivered. AliExpress Dropshipping makes it easy for you to track packages sent all across the world and reduce the WISMO (Where is My Order) tickets significantly. Build brand trust with trackable delivery & express free shipping to the U.S. customers.

###Competitive Shipping Cost

Shipping cost is a big consideration for those who are in the dropshipping business. It is crucial to be competitive in terms of pricing to get more sales compared to your competitors. AliExpress Dropshipping makes sure that you get competitive shipping costs to generate higher profit margins.

###Pricing Automation

Pricing Automation is another handy feature of AliExpress Dropshipping with which instead of setting prices for all your products manually, you can create global pricing rules that will automatically price all your products for you. With this feature, you can set your pricing rules once and apply them automatically when adding products to your import list. All you need to do is, assign a fixed price, multiplier and compared price to the imported products. Pricing rules apply automatically when you import products to the import list.

###Bulk Product Editor

With the Bulk Product Editor, you can easily change or edit the product details such as photos, title, descriptions, Woocommerce collection, product type, and tags, along with pricing and images all at once.
